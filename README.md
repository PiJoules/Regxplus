# [Regx]+
Inspired by [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/), another regular expression crossword puzzle game.

I was sad that there was a limited number of these puzzles since they were so much fun, so I made a random regex generator, allowing there to be more or less an unlimited number of problems to solve.

Edit: I just found out that [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/) allows for user submitted puzzles. Regardless, this was still fun to make.

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
